As I had terrible English teacher in high school who was stupid, stubborn and
overall bad person, who only knew tenses, I never learned anything from her.
Luckily, she only lectured tenses, so there wasn't much of English language I
hate because of her. I'll write about what I learn, starting from scratch.

PS. Thank you, Maja!
